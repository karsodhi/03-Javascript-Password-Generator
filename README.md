Password Generator

# 02-homework
This is the third homework challenge that was presented to us.  I used java script to create a password with the length of 8 to 128 characters at random.  When clicking on generate password it prompts use to create a password within the length limits then follows up with questions regarding if we'd like to add numbers, special characters, and upper and lower case letters.  After it goes through all the prompts it then generates a password for us to use.
